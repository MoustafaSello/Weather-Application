# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Main Screen of the Weather App:
    An input field that asks for a valid City Zip Code.
    Another input field to ask for the current feeling.
    A Button called " Generate " that it calls the APIs to get the city of the Zip Code and the current Temperature from the weather server.
    A Small window that displays the Date, City of the Zip code and the Temperature of this City, also displays the current feeling input.

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.
